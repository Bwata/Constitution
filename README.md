# Time for a change.

It is clear that the system needs work. Time to change it. This is a project to edit the Constitution for the United States of America. There will be good and bad changes but that is what is good and bad about people. Please create many pull requests. I am not sure how the changes will be determined but there will be consensus.

The initial commit is the constitution as it was when first signed. Each ammendment will be added as the first commits.
